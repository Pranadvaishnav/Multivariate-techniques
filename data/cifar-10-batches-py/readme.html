neural network in PyTorch. It is a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer. 
The input layer has 3072 neurons (corresponding to the 32x32x3 pixel values of the CIFAR-10 images), 
the hidden layer has 100 neurons, and the output layer has 10 neurons (corresponding to the 10 classes in CIFAR-10).
The activation function used is ReLU for the hidden layer and softmax for the output layer.
